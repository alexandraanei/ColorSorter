## **ABOUT**
Initially, the colored M&M's which are held in the charger drop into the platform attached on the top servo motor.
Then the servo motor rotates and brings the M&M to the color sensor which detects its color.
After that the bottom servo motor rotates to the particular position and then the top servo motor rotates again till the M&M drop into the guide rail.

## **BUILD PROCESS**
Using a small hand saw, I cut all the parts to size.
Once I got all the parts ready, I started assembling them. First I assembled the outer parts using a glue gun.
Then using all-purpose glue I glued the two servo motors on their platforms and attached them to the assembly.
After that again using a glue I attached the guide rail on the bottom servo motor as well as the support and the platform needed for the top servo motor.
Next, I inserted a switch and a power jack for powering the Arduino with a 5V adapter and on the third platform I inserted the color sensor.
